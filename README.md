## About
Matter Overdrive is a Minecraft mod inspired by the popular Sci-fi TV series Star Trek. It dwells in the concept of replicating and transforming one type matter into another.
Although it may seem overpowered, Matter Overdrive takes a more realistic approach and requires the player to build a complex system before even the simplest replication can be achieved.

https://github.com/infiniteblock/MatterOverdrive-Community-Edition/issues

Todo:

1. Allow energy transfer across matter network cables. That way connectivity and power go over one set of cables.
2. ~~Make the microwave able to "cook" food like furnaces do, getting power from RF.~~ Done. If ores are put in the microwave, make it explode.
3. Fix network flash drives to properly filter destinations.
